# Movie-Recommender-System
Our work has two python scripts files: NetworkTraining.py and Recommender system.py.  
The first file is about the creation of the graph and training of our network, then it will return a saved model.  
The second one is our recommender system. It will unzip movie data and complete data processing then implemente three type recommendation with the use of saved model and parameters.
