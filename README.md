# Movie-Recommender-System
Our work has two python scripts files: NetworkTraining.py and Recommender system.py.
The first file is about data downloading and data preprocessing, and it will produce a .p file with processed data.
The first file is about the construction of the graph and training of our network.And the running time of this file may take 
some time and will return a saved model.
The second one is our recommender system. It will unzip movie data and complete data processing then implemente three type recommendation with the use of saved model and parameters.
